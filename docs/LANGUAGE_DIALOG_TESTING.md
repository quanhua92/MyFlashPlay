# Language Selection Dialog - Testing Guide

## üîß **Fixed Issues**

The dialog now properly saves language preferences! Here's what was fixed:

1. **Correct API Usage**: Now uses `setLanguage` instead of `changeLanguage`
2. **Proper Storage**: Uses the correct localStorage key (`myflashplay_preferences`)
3. **Language Format**: Saves in the correct format (e.g., "es-ES", "fr-FR")
4. **Debug Logging**: Added console logs to track the process

## üß™ **Testing Instructions**

### Method 1: Test First-Time User Experience

1. **Clear localStorage** (simulate new user):
   ```javascript
   // Open browser console (F12) and run:
   localStorage.removeItem('myflashplay-first-time-language');
   localStorage.removeItem('myflashplay_preferences');
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Dialog should appear after 500ms
   - Select any language (e.g., Spanish)
   - Click "Continue with Spanish" 
   - Dialog should close and interface should change to Spanish

### Method 2: Use Preview Button

1. Go to **Settings** page
2. Scroll to **Language** section  
3. Click **"Preview Language Dialog"** button
4. Test language selection

### Method 3: Check Console Logs

Open browser console (F12) to see debug information:
- "Language selection check" - shows detection logic
- "Selecting language: [code]" - when language is chosen
- "Language selection completed" - when successfully saved

## ‚úÖ **Verification Steps**

After selecting a language, verify it worked:

1. **Visual Check**: Interface text should change to selected language
2. **Storage Check**: 
   ```javascript
   // Check in console:
   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('myflashplay_preferences'))
   // Should show: { language: "es-ES" } (or your selected language)
   ```
3. **Navigation Check**: Navigate to different pages - language should persist
4. **Reload Check**: Refresh page - selected language should remain

## üêõ **If It Still Doesn't Work**

1. **Check Console**: Look for any error messages
2. **Verify Build**: Make sure you're running the latest build
3. **Clear All Storage**: 
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```
4. **Test in Incognito**: Try in a private/incognito window

## üìù **Expected Console Output**

When working correctly, you should see:
```
Language selection check: {
  hasSeenLanguageDialog: false,
  hasLanguagePreference: false, 
  shouldShowDialog: true,
  currentLanguage: "en"
}

Selecting language: es
Language selection completed
```

The language change should be immediate and visible throughout the app!
