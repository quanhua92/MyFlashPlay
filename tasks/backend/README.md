# MyFlashPlay Backend Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a backend system for MyFlashPlay using Rust workers-rs and Cloudflare Workers with SQLite in Durable Objects. The primary goal is to enable seamless multi-device synchronization for user data including decks, achievements, progress, starred content, and preferences.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (Edge Computing)
- **Language**: Rust with workers-rs crate
- **Database**: SQLite with Durable Objects
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with double password hashing
- **Storage**: Per-user Durable Objects for data isolation

### Key Features
1. **Authentication System**: Email-based registration/login with UUID v7 user identification
2. **Multi-Device Sync**: Real-time synchronization across devices
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Timestamp-based merging with intelligent conflict handling
4. **Data Types**: My Decks, Achievements, Progress, Starred Decks, Preferences
5. **Security**: Client-side and server-side password hashing

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure
- Initialize Rust project with workers-rs
- Configure dependencies and project structure
- Set up basic worker entry point
- Create development environment

### Stage 2: Database Schema and Durable Objects
- Design SQLite schema for all data types
- Implement Durable Objects for data persistence
- Create database connection and migration system
- Set up per-user data isolation

### Stage 3: Authentication System
- User registration and login endpoints
- Double password hashing implementation
- UUID v7 generation for users
- JWT token management and validation

### Stage 4: Core API Endpoints
- User management endpoints
- CRUD operations for decks, achievements, progress
- Starred content and preferences management
- Input validation and error handling

### Stage 5: Sync Logic and Conflict Resolution
- Sync endpoints with timestamp-based merging
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Delta sync for performance optimization
- Real-time update capabilities

### Stage 6: Testing and Deployment
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Performance and load testing
- Deployment configuration for Cloudflare
- Documentation and monitoring setup

## Design Principles

1. **Data Isolation**: Each user has their own Durable Object instance
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with intelligent merging
3. **Performance**: Edge computing for low latency
4. **Security**: Multiple layers of password hashing and validation
5. **Scalability**: Durable Objects provide automatic scaling
