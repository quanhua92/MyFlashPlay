# Falling Quiz Game Mode - Design & Implementation Plan

## Game Concept
A new game mode featuring a 3-lane vertical screen where quiz questions fall down like a rhythm game. Players must answer correctly to make quizzes "pop" and disappear.

## Game Mechanics
- **3 Vertical Lanes**: Screen divided into 3 equal vertical columns
- **Falling Quizzes**: Questions drop from top to bottom at controlled speed
- **Answer Buttons**: Each lane has answer buttons at the bottom
- **Correct Answer**: Quiz pops with positive visual feedback
- **Wrong Answer**: Emotional warning feedback (shake, color change)
- **Speed Learning**: Fast correct answers = better learning reinforcement

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
1. **FallingQuizMode.tsx** - Main game component
2. **FallingQuizItem.tsx** - Individual falling quiz component
3. **GameLane.tsx** - Single lane management
4. **Answer Button Interface** - Touch/click friendly buttons

### Game State Management
- Active quizzes per lane (position, content, speed)
- Score tracking and streak counters
- Time-based difficulty scaling
- Game completion detection

### Visual Design
- Responsive layout (desktop/mobile friendly)
- Smooth CSS animations for falling motion
- Particle effects for correct answers
- Shake/warning animations for wrong answers
- Progress indicators

### Mobile Optimizations
- Large touch targets for buttons
- Optimized animation performance
- Responsive lane sizing
- Gesture-friendly interactions
