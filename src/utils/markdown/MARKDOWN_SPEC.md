## Parsing Rules

1. **Line-based parsing**: Each line is processed independently
2. **Trim whitespace**: Leading/trailing whitespace is removed
3. **Empty lines**: Used to separate different card types
4. **Headers**: Lines starting with # or ## define categories
5. **Comments**: HTML comments are parsed for metadata
6. **Special characters**: :: is the separator, > marks correct answer
7. **Flexible format**: Parser should be forgiving of minor format variations
